# Cloud-Computing
* Application running on-premises using local network other than your laptop no one can access the application.
* In On-premises, Servers, Network, Databases, Security and storage all should be managed by us but instead of managing them We can use cloud providers. Cloud providers provide these services where we have to configure according to our need.
* On-Premises, resources like Storage, Cpu, RAM are limited when we are trying to scale up the servers it is not possible.
* So Now we wil take the application which we have deployed on-premises on to the  cloud.
### What is cloud computing?
* Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center

### What is a Cloud Service Provider?
* A cloud service provider, or CSP, is an IT company that provides on-demand, scalable computing resources like computing power, data storage, or applications over the internet. Typically, cloud-based service models are defined as IaaS (infrastructure as a service), PaaS (platform as a service), or SaaS (software as a service).

### Datacenters
* A data center is a physical room, building or facility that houses IT infrastructure for building, running and delivering applications and services. It also stores and manages the data associated with those applications and services.
* Data centers started out as privately owned, tightly controlled on-premises facilities housing traditional IT infrastructure for the exclusive use of one company. Recently, they've evolved into remote facilities or networks of facilities owned by cloud service providers (CSPs). These CSP data centers house virtualized IT infrastructure for the shared use of multiple companies and customers.
* These datacenters will be accessed by multiple users accross the world.
* In cloud provider, 1 availability zone has 1 datacenter.
* In AWS, we have 34 Regions, Each region will have 3 to 6 AZs
* We have multiple AZs for disaster recovery and high availability.
* If one AZ crashes we have other AZ for backup.
* Distance b/w each zone is 100 to 150km.

### How cloud service provider divide its resources?
**Virtualisation:** Virtualization is technology that you can use to create virtual representations of servers, storage, networks, and other physical machines. Virtual software mimics the functions of physical hardware to run multiple virtual machines simultaneously on a single physical machine.

### How virtualisation is possible?
**Hypervisor:** A hypervisor is a software that you can use to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine. Every virtual machine has its own operating system and applications. The hypervisor allocates the underlying physical computing resources such as CPU and memory to individual virtual machines as required.

### Cloud Service Models
1. IAAS(Infrastructure as a Service)(EC2)
2. PAAS(Platform as a Service)(RDS)
3. SAAS(Software as a Service)(Cloudwatch)
